# Harness Improvements Queue

A log of observations about the Claude Code harness for this project — rules, agent prompts, slash commands, hooks, and the docs that support them. The `harness-auditor` agent consumes this file and decides how to resolve each open item (update CLAUDE.md, tighten an agent, add a hook, update docs, or mark as won't-fix).

## Who appends here

- **qa** — when it finds a convention followed in code but not documented, a check that should be automated, or a pattern worth catching next time.
- **docs-sync** — when a doc section is vague enough that drift is inevitable, or when a convention should be lifted into CLAUDE.md.
- **Main agent (Claude)** — when the user corrects my approach mid-session. Log it so the auditor can decide whether the rules or docs allowed the mistake.
- **Nic** — anything you want me to reconsider.

## Format

```markdown
### {YYYY-MM-DD} · {source} · {one-line summary}

**Context:** {what was happening}
**Observation:** {the gap / pattern / correction}
**Suggested action:** {optional — what the reporter thinks should change}
```

`source` is one of: `qa`, `docs-sync`, `user-correction`, `manual`.

## Auditor workflow

When the auditor processes an item, it moves the entry from `## Open Items` to `## Resolved`, adding a `**Resolution:**` line with the date, classification (rule/agent/command/hook/docs/won't-fix), and link to the change.

### 2026-04-17 · manual · Phase 3 contact count: plan says ~18, spec lists 14

**Context:** Executing Phase 3. `docs/implementation-plan.md` Phase 3 step 3 says "~18 contacts across emergency, medical, municipal categories" and Phase 9 says "All seeded contacts display in correct groups." But `docs/spec.md` "Seed Data — Real" only enumerates 14 contacts (3 emergency + 3 medical + 8 municipal). I seeded the 14 from spec since that's the canonical data source.
**Observation:** Numeric drift between the plan and spec. Could be that the plan was written when the spec had more contacts, or vice versa. The "Fjölskylda" and "Annað" categories are defined in the schema but have zero seed entries — those would push the count toward 18 if family phone numbers were filled in (also flagged as "Open Items" in the plan).
**Suggested action:** `docs-sync` should reconcile — either update the plan's count to "~14 (more once family phone numbers are gathered)" or, if there's missing seed data the plan expected, surface the gap.

### 2026-04-17 · qa · docs/spec.md has incorrect `by_creation` index on `logEntries`

**Context:** Phase 3 QA. The spec (`docs/spec.md`) defines `logEntries` with `.index("by_creation", ["_creationTime"])`. When this was tried, Convex rejected it because it auto-appends `_creationTime` to every index and forbids explicit references to it. The staged schema correctly omits this index.
**Observation:** `docs/spec.md` contains a Convex index definition that will fail at deploy time. Any developer copying the schema verbatim will hit a Convex error. The implementation notes the fix ("had to drop `by_creation` index") but docs still have the bad definition.
**Suggested action:** `docs-sync` should remove `.index("by_creation", ["_creationTime"])` from the `logEntries` definition in `docs/spec.md` and add a note: "Default Convex ordering is by `_creationTime` ascending — no explicit index needed."

## Resolved

### 2026-04-16 · user-correction · Default to the plan when repo state diverges from it

**Context:** Phase 0 review. I noticed the repo had ESLint installed while `docs/implementation-plan.md` prescribes Biome, and I recommended keeping ESLint to "reduce churn." Nic corrected me: the ESLint setup was accidental, and he wants me to follow the plan (Biome).
**Observation:** When implementation has drifted from the documented plan, I defaulted to "keep what's there" rather than "follow the plan." No rule tells me which way to default. A human reviewer would have the same problem, but agents rotate through this project and will re-discover the same ambiguity.
**Suggested action:** Add a rule to `CLAUDE.md` (or the `docs-sync` agent): when `docs/spec.md` or `docs/implementation-plan.md` diverges from repo state, the default is to treat the plan as canonical unless the user explicitly says otherwise. If you're about to recommend a change that contradicts the plan, raise it as a question to the user before recommending.
**Resolution:** 2026-04-17 · rule · Added "plan wins by default" bullet under **Source of Truth** in `CLAUDE.md`.

### 2026-04-16 · docs-sync · proxy.ts location should be `src/proxy.ts`, not project root

**Context:** Phase 1 auth setup. The spec (`docs/spec.md`) and plan (`docs/implementation-plan.md`) both say `proxy.ts` lives at project root. I initially created it there, and the proxy never ran — Next.js 16's file resolution for `proxy.ts|js` is "project root OR `src/` if `app/` is under `src/`." Since this project uses `src/app/`, the proxy must be at `src/proxy.ts`. After moving it, the redirect fired correctly (307 → `/login` for unauthed requests).
**Observation:** The plan and spec reference the wrong path. `docs/implementation-plan.md` Phase 1 file list says "`proxy.ts` — Auth redirect logic" and Phase 2 says "Merge i18n routing into `proxy.ts`." `docs/spec.md` file tree shows `proxy.ts` at the root alongside `convex/` and `src/`. Both should say `src/proxy.ts`.
**Suggested action:** `docs-sync` should update both files: (a) move `proxy.ts` into the `src/` branch of the file tree in `spec.md`; (b) update the Phase 1 and Phase 2 file lists in `implementation-plan.md`; (c) tighten `CLAUDE.md`'s "Breaking" note on Next.js 16 to mention the location requirement when using `src/app/`. Could also be caught by an automated check: if `app/` is under `src/`, `proxy.ts|js` must be under `src/` too.
**Resolution:** 2026-04-17 · rule + docs · `CLAUDE.md`'s Next.js 16 "Breaking" bullet and Architecture Notes bullet now prescribe `src/proxy.ts` when `app/` is under `src/`. Mirror into `docs/spec.md` + `docs/implementation-plan.md` delegated to `docs-sync`.

### 2026-04-16 · docs-sync · proxy.ts must use `export default`, not a named `proxy` export

**Context:** Phase 1 auth setup. Both `docs/spec.md` and `docs/implementation-plan.md` (plus `CLAUDE.md`'s Next.js 16 "Breaking" note) say `proxy.ts` should export a function named `proxy` (i.e. `export const proxy = ...` or `export function proxy`). I first did this. The app 500'd on every request with `TypeError: adapterFn is not a function` originating from `node_modules/next/dist/server/next-server.js` line where Next resolves the proxy via `middlewareModule.default || middlewareModule`. Switching to `export default convexAuthNextjsMiddleware(...)` fixed it. A plain named export works in simpler proxy bodies but breaks when the proxy is wrapped (Convex Auth's `convexAuthNextjsMiddleware` — and presumably next-intl's `createMiddleware` wrapper too) because Turbopack's server bundle only surfaces the default export in the adapter path.
**Observation:** The docs confidently prescribe the named-`proxy` convention as the Next.js 16 rename rule, but in practice every wrapped-middleware setup in this project must use default export. Phase 2 (i18n) combines two wrappers, which makes default export even more load-bearing. The docs/CLAUDE.md rule is actively misleading.
**Suggested action:** `docs-sync` should update `CLAUDE.md`'s Next.js 16 breaking-changes bullet, `docs/spec.md`'s proxy example, and `docs/implementation-plan.md` Phase 2 note. Replace "export named `proxy`" with "export default" (or, at most, "either a named `proxy` export or default export, but wrapped middlewares like Convex Auth require default"). Also note the failure signature (`adapterFn is not a function`) so the next agent recognizes it immediately.
**Resolution:** 2026-04-17 · rule + docs · `CLAUDE.md` Stack bullet now prescribes `export default` and notes the `adapterFn is not a function` failure signature. Mirror into `docs/spec.md` + `docs/implementation-plan.md` Phase 2 delegated to `docs-sync`.

### 2026-04-16 · qa · QA agent lacks guidance for harness-only / no-production-code diffs

**Context:** First real QA run. The staged diff was entirely `.claude/` harness setup plus `CLAUDE.md` / `.gitignore` — no production code. The qa.md playbook assumes a Next.js/Convex diff and lists Next16/Convex/i18n/UX/seed checks as "Always" or "once convex/ exists", but gives no explicit guidance for diffs that touch zero production code.
**Observation:** I had to invent a SKIP rationale for each product-domain check ("no production code in diff"). A future QA run on another harness-only change would re-derive the same reasoning. Worse, a less careful agent might run Next16 grep checks on `.claude/` markdown and produce spurious findings (e.g., "middleware" appears in agent prompts as a convention reference).
**Suggested action:** Add a short section to `.claude/agents/qa.md` titled "Harness-only diffs" that says: if the staged diff only touches `.claude/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.gitignore`, or `docs/**`, skip Next16/Convex/i18n/UX/seed checks with reason "no production code", still run lint + typecheck, and additionally verify: hook scripts are executable, agent/command frontmatter parses, `settings.json` is valid JSON, `.claude/.qa-passed` remains gitignored.
**Resolution:** 2026-04-17 · agent · Added a `### Harness-only diffs` section to `.claude/agents/qa.md` with exactly the rules above.

### 2026-04-17 · qa · Root `metadata` description is hardcoded Icelandic, not per-locale

**Context:** Phase 2 QA. `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` exports a static `metadata` object with `title: "Sigga"` and `description: "Fjölskyldusamráð um umönnun Siggu"`. The description is Icelandic only — visitors on `/en/...` (and search/PWA-install previews) will see the Icelandic string. English is secondary in this project, so this is low-impact, but it is the exact kind of "hardcoded user-facing string in a TSX file" the `qa` playbook's i18n check is supposed to catch, and I nearly let it pass because the playbook's grep heuristic targets body-rendered strings.
**Observation:** (1) The i18n check in `.claude/agents/qa.md` focuses on strings inside JSX elements; it has no explicit mention of `metadata`/`generateMetadata`. (2) The correct next-intl pattern is `export async function generateMetadata({ params })` using `getTranslations`, which neither the spec nor the implementation plan's Phase 2 exit criteria call out. (3) `messages/{is,en}.json` already contain `app.name` and `app.tagline` — the translations exist and are unused for metadata.
**Suggested action:** (a) Tighten the qa playbook's i18n check to explicitly include `export const metadata` / `generateMetadata` strings. (b) `docs-sync` should add a `generateMetadata` example to the Phase 2 section of `docs/implementation-plan.md` and to the layout example in `docs/spec.md`. (c) Non-blocking follow-up for Nic: swap `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` to `generateMetadata` so `/en/...` gets the English tagline.
**Resolution:** 2026-04-17 · agent + docs · `.claude/agents/qa.md` i18n check now flags hardcoded `metadata`/`generateMetadata` strings in `src/app/[locale]/**`. `generateMetadata` example for spec/plan delegated to `docs-sync`. Code fix in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` tracked in conversation as a Phase 2 follow-up.
